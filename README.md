This project was conceived as my final year project, but my vision extended beyond it being just a major project. Throughout my time at the university, I have encountered various challenges related to transportation, faculty, classrooms, and more. With these experiences in mind, I aimed to create a platform where students, especially those who are shy or hesitant to communicate their queries directly, can post their questions and receive answers. Additionally, I have endeavored to incorporate as many features as possible to assist students comprehensively.
